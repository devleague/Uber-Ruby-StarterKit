# Uber Ruby StarterKit

Uber Hackathon Starter Kit for Ruby

The sample code makes calls to the [sandbox api](https://developer.uber.com/v1/sandbox/) endpoints at https://sandbox-api.uber.com/v1/

The sandbox url should be used for development.

The production api url is https://api.uber.com/v1/

## Requirements

- have an uber account
- create an app at https://developer.uber.com
- have ruby installed (tested with ruby 2.2.3p173)
- have rails installed (tested with rails 4.2.4)
- clone this project, all commands are issued from inside this project directory

### Environment Variables

You should never commit your secret/private information to your scm.

Each script requires environment variables to be set in a file named `.env`

copy `.env-sample` to `.env` and follow the template to add your uber api keys

example

```
UBER_SERVER_TOKEN="YOUR-SECRET-KEY-HERE"
UBER_CLIENT_ID="YOUR-SECRET-KEY-HERE"
UBER_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR-SECRET-KEY-HERE"
```

this information can be found from your uber developer console by editing an app that you have created. https://developer.uber.com/dashboard

scripts will be run by reading the `.env` file. the env variables are set during when running a script per _session_, that is, the environment variables will not persist.

this is done by running `env $(cat .env | xargs) ...your command`

if you do not have the `xargs` program (it is installed in osx and ubuntu linux by default), then you can install it for your operating system.

or, set each environment variable manually without `.env`

example

```
UBER_SERVER_TOKEN=your-uber-server-token \
UBER_CLIENT_ID=your-uber-client-id \
UBER_CLIENT_SECRET=your-cient-secret \
...your command
```

## Problems?

if you are seeing errors, make sure that there is a `.env` file located in the current directory which should be the project root, and that it is in the same format as `.env-sample` and that it has valid secret keys and tokens from the uber developer api.

## Simple requests

The Uber API has 3 routes that only require server side authentication, and do not require a user to authorize via OAuth2

```
GET /v1/products
GET /v1/estimates/time
GET /v1/estimates/price
```
